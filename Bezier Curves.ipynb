    "Bézier curves are ubiquitous.  They are easy to implement, and can be used to model curves on manufactured goods:  cars, airplanes, shoes...or even sketches, like the dachshund above. All computer graphics routines use Bezier curves, as do all PostScript and Truetype fonts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pierre Bézier was an engineer working for the French car company Renault.  In the 1950's, car companies like Renault and Citroën used physical models, often in clay, for development purposes.  When going from development to production, these models were scaled up (*tediously*, using French curves and flexible spline rulers), a 'master model' was made, and then parts designed based on it -- often relying on the skill and ingenuity of workers to best approximate the shape of the model.  This method left significant room for error and inconsistencey.  There was a need for a common 'curve language' to systematize the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bézier implemented a clever method that he learned from Prof. Onésime Durand, a brilliant mathematician that had been one of his instructors.  Prof. Durand's insight was that the shape of a curve can be characterized by a dynamic polygonal line (shown dashed below), and that by manipulating this containing broken line one could alter the curve to the desired shape."

    "Oh, one point of clarification before we get to the algebra:  In an interview conducted in 1990, Bézier admitted that there was no Prof. Onésime Durand; he was complete fiction.  Bézier felt that if he presented this idea as his own (which it was), that others at Renault would not have confidence in it (one probably *should* suspect math methods developed by engineers...).

Unlike Renault, however, Citroën was highly proprietary about de Casteljau's work, and it remained secret until 1975, long after Bézier curves were widely publicized in the 1960's."

Shown is the original function (thick blue line) and the Bernstein polynomial function approximations $B_2(f,x)$, $B_4(f,x)$, $B_{10}(f,x)$, $B_{20}(f,x)$, and $B_{40}(f,x)$.    While these polynomials do converge to the function, the rate of convergence is glacial; too slow to be of much practical use."

By using Bézier curves, it is quick and easy to reproduce the same shape in different sizes.
